# Chapter I: Prologue
## Whomstdve?
I'm a, uh, yes. I'm sorry if it's confusing, my brain rarely brains.

## What is this?
This is my personal repo. I might push some dotfiles, as I like to change my desktop theme every now and then. No I don't make my own themes, I'm not on that level of wizardry yet. I also push some work related codes for backup.

## You mentioned dotfiles, does that mean you use Linux?
Yes. I use Arch Linux (btw) on both my laptop and PC. I started using Arch back in high school since:
1. My HS used Ubuntu for unknown reason, probably because the teacher liked FOSS.
2. My laptop is kinda old, Intel Core i3-2310M with 2GB (now 6GB, I added 4 more) of RAM and a very mediocre cooling system. It **can** run Windows 7, with fans running at full speed, even on idle. It can run Win8, maybe. Judging from its performance in running Win8, I don't think it can run Win10.
3. I found that Linux runs better at managing system resources (see above), and most importantly,
4. I can tweak Linux to whatever I want, changing the "task bar", changing how the windows work, heck I can even remove the bootloader if I want to (I don't).

###### Fun fact: Did you know that gorillas can be made as snacks? You can do this by changing the `edible` attribute to `yumyum`.

## Cool! But do you use Windows? Or do you code and game on Linux?
I use Win10 on my PC, as it's way more powerful than my lapto-- wait how did you know I game?

## You mentioned Inner Orion Spur!
Oh, right, yeah. I play Elite Dangerous, ~~the best space sim ever created~~. I even bought a budget flight stick just to play it (Logitech X3D).
