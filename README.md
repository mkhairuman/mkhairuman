# :grinning: :wave: Hiya! Welcome to my github, now with README 2.0: Electric Boogaloo.
- :orange_book: I'm an undergrad, currently working as back end developer in a private software house company as an intern.
- :question: This is both my personal and work backup github. The work repos are private, obviously. I know that storing works in a personal repo is a bad practice, but the work repo is live, so..
- :microphone: I speak Indonesian and English, but the latter is preferred. Don't ask me why. I just think straighter in English.
- :desktop_computer: I can type in JavaScript (my primary language in my current work). I can also type in whatever the scripts from [unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) uses.
- :seedling: I am always looking for ways to improve myself, including work. Because as written in :orange_book:, I'm an intern, so I still have a lot to learn ~~and as we all know, interns don't get paid~~.
- :joystick: I do play some games in my free time. Currently, I'm finishing Hogwarts Legacy. I also play Elite Dangerous in my other free time. I also play some ~~gacha~~ mobile games.
